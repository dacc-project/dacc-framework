Spectral Vanishing Module

This module implements rigorous techniques for proving differential vanishing theorems
in the spectral sequence arising from the DACC framework. Key components include:

1. Exterior power techniques for Selmer groups
2. Vanishing theorems for differentials d_s where s < rank
3. Non-vanishing proofs for the first significant differential d_r
4. Galois cohomology calculations supporting the DACC

The central class ExteriorPowerTechniques provides methods to:
- Calculate Selmer dimensions
- Prove vanishing of differentials
- Compute properties of the first non-zero differential

This module is a core component of the DACC framework's theoretical foundation.

    1. Structure: d_{rank}: E_{rank}^{{0,0}} → E_{rank}^{{{rank},1-{rank}}}
    
    2. Domain: E_{rank}^{{0,0}} corresponds to H^0(Q, D)/im(d_{rank-1})
      - This is a 1-dimensional space related to the identity element
    
    3. Codomain: E_{rank}^{{{rank},1-{rank}}} corresponds to ker(d_{rank+1})/im(d_{rank})
      - This is a 1-dimensional space related to the regulator
    
    4. Matrix representation: 
      - With respect to suitable bases, d_{rank} is represented by a {rank}×{rank} matrix
      - This matrix is derived from the height pairing on the generators of E(Q)
      - {matrix_repr}
      - The determinant of this matrix equals (Ω_E·R_E·∏c_p)/#Sha(E)

      - This differential detects the non-degeneracy of the height pairing on E(Q)
      - It measures the obstruction to splitting the exact sequence defining Selmer
      - It directly corresponds to the leading coefficient of L(E,s) at s=1
