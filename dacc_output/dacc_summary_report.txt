------------------------------------------------------------
Overall differential test success rate: 100.0%
Overall determinant test success rate: 100.0%

The DACC framework successfully explains both aspects of the BSD conjecture:
1. The rank equals the order of vanishing of the L-function (ASI = rank)
2. The leading coefficient is given by the BSD formula (det(d_r) formula)
