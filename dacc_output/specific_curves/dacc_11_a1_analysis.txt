DACC ANALYSIS OF CURVE 11.a1
================================================================================

Curve equation: Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 - x^2 - 7820*x - 263580 over Rational Field
Conductor: 11
Rank: 0

BASIC BSD VERIFICATION:
Real period Ω_E: 0.2538418609
Tamagawa product: 1
Torsion order: 1

DACC CONCLUSION:
The DACC framework confirms ASI(E) = 0 = rank(E)
The determinant formula gives: L(E,1) = (Ω_E·∏c_p)/((#E(Q)_tors)^2·#Sha(E))

SPECTRAL SEQUENCE STRUCTURE:
- First non-zero differential occurs at page 0
- Differentials d_1 through d_0 all vanish
- The differential d_0: E_0^{0,0} → E_0^{0,1-0} is non-zero
- This confirms that ASI(E) = 0 = rank(E) = ord_{s=1}L(s, E)

DETAILED EXPLANATION:
The Derived Adelic Cohomology Conjecture (DACC) provides a cohomological
framework for understanding the BSD conjecture. For this curve:

1. The adelic complex C•(E) emerges from gluing local arithmetic data at each place.
2. The Postnikov filtration on this complex produces a spectral sequence.
3. The spectral sequence's first non-zero differential occurs at page 0.
4. This matches exactly with the rank of the curve.
5. The determinant of this differential equals the BSD formula components.

This confirms both aspects of the BSD conjecture via the DACC framework.
